# Recruitment

The Java Recruitment project is a comprehensive console application designed to streamline the recruitment process. Users can register as recruiters, recruits, or validators. Recruiters have the privilege to post job offers specifying required skills and job descriptions, while recruits can browse through available jobs that match their skill sets. Validators play a crucial role in confirming the skills listed by recruiters and validating job postings.

One unique feature of this application is the ability for users to engage in discussions by commenting on profiles and job offers, with validators having the authority to confirm these comments. An administrator oversees the entire platform, managing job offers, skills, and user interactions.

Data management is handled efficiently through CSV files, ensuring smooth operations within the Java console environment. The project aims to simplify and enhance the recruitment experience for both employers and job seekers
